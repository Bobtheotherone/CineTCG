# Security Policy

## Supported versions

This is an early-stage prototype. Only the latest `main` branch is supported.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, report it privately:

- If this repository has GitHub Security Advisories enabled: use **"Report a vulnerability"**.
- Otherwise: contact the maintainers via email (add a project contact here before making the repo public).

We will acknowledge receipt and work with you on a coordinated disclosure.
